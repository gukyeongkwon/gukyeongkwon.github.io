  Hi, my name is Gukyeong Kwon. I am a Ph.D. student advised by [Dr. Ghassan AlRegib](https://ghassanalregib.info/){:target="_blank"} at Georgia Tech. My research interests are <mark>deep learning</mark>, <mark>computer vision</mark>, and <mark>image/video processing</mark>. In particular, I have primarily focused on achieving the robustness of deep learning algorithms through representation learning.

  Please check my [CV](resume/Gukyeong_Kwon_CV.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=So9yfEQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} for more information.
